# MazeSolver
A maze solving program that recursively solves a text-based maze using a ref-based linked list of previous moves.

This was a school project. 
Thus, many of the files are not authored by me but are required for package completeness, hence their inclusion here. 
All authors have been referenced at the top of each code file.
